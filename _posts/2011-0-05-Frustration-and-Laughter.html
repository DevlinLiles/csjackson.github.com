title: Frustration & Laughter
---

The past week has proven somewhat frustrating, both for me and for my trainer. Honesty demands that I admit that I neglected my homework during the week, made all the more damning, since the freakish weather meant that I had little chance to actually work during that time. 
<p>
This made the beginning of the Thursday session a little tense, a fact only compounded by its length. In an attempt to make up for the Tuesday snow day, we worked nearly 4 hours on Thursday. Somewhere in that time, my ability to process and store information must have been saturated, because much of we’d done looked alien when I tried to make sense of it on Friday, and Saturday morning.
<p>
Recognizing that I needed more time to assimilate the concepts of dependency injection, Tim eased back on the throttle a little, and let me use much of the session as lab time, answering questions as they came up. I flatter myself that I made good use of the time, because when I left the studio that afternoon, I could actually explain the process of creating a command in our game, and the tests that could prove they worked. I also proved to myself that a break somewhere in the middle of a 4-hour block will be necessary for me to process what I’d just learned.
<p>
It’s a good thing I can, too, since I gather that game development in going to be relegated to homework time, and I’m going to work on other projects during class periods. Since that time, I repeated the kihon a couple of times, and have created a new command, “LOL”, which has slightly different behavior, depending on whether or not there is a second word. More importantly, I created the tests proved this. Creating the tests did help me decide exactly what I wanted the behaviors to be, which I think was another reason to write a failing test before writing the code to make it pass.
