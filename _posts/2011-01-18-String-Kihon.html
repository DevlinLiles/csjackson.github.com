title: String Kihon
---
<p>
	For reasons shrouded in mystery, Ft Worth DNUG was pushed from the 18<sup>th</sup> to the 25<sup>th</sup> Now it conflicts with Dallas ASP.net UG. Thankfully, Tim found out about it early enough to let me know, so I gathered my kit from my house, and headed to his for a training session, rather than sit in an empty Justins parking lot.</p>
<p>
	We were using a site called <a href="https://github.com/">GITHub</a> tonight which, as you might imagine, interacts with GIT. This means that you can have all your people use a web site as a source repository. Awesome for a distributed development force.</p>
<p>
	He also introduced a series of short exercises which he called a &ldquo;Kihon&rdquo;. These are dills on various common functions inside the .net framework. These are consepts &amp; commands used so commonly by developers that they don&rsquo;t think about them. Seeing this gave me more hope for getting past the first and highest hurdle of this project. I&rsquo;ve worked with Tim before, and it is often hard to explain the vast vistas of my ignorance. &nbsp;Clearly he has come to some peace with it, and is less likely to consider it some moral failing on my part.</p>
<p>
	The first kihon is all about string manipulation. Of the 14, I got 9 done in the time allotted, and 3 of those I made 3 lines of code, where 1 would have sufficed. As I write this, I see that he has updated this file &ndash; apparently, one was broken. So, I&rsquo;ll pull down the most recent version before I repeat it.</p>
