	January 14-16, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://givecamp.org/">GiveCamp</a></p>
<p>
	<a href="http://dallasgivecamp.org/">Dallas GiveCamp</a>: A chance to rub elbows with some of DFW&rsquo;s strongest programmers, see them in action, and burnish my own resume a little in the process. Tim had to practically drag me along, pointing out that since I was working for free (less meals &amp; snacks), there&rsquo;s no way I could be less use to the project than my pay.</p>
<p>
	Turns out I should not have worried. As I met my team, there were several different skill levels present, and one, James, was a recent IT convert like myself. Also, since we were going to working in a new CRM that nobody had really seen before, everyone was going to be bumping around a good deal and asking each other lots of questions. Between that, and a quick explanation of my utter n00b status, folks seemed happy enough to work with me &amp; nobody got frustrated with my pestering questions.</p>
<p>
	Friday afternoon started in a whirl. Tim likes to say he was useless that day, though his backpack was indispensable. Quickly accessing the needs of the project, the skills of his team, &amp; the limitations of the local internet access , he actually put us on Saturday morning&rsquo;s problems a whole day ahead of every other team. Tim also became our team&rsquo;s IT manager for the event, turning his beast of a laptop into both a local network hotspot, and a server so that we could install Sitefinity 4, and actually get to work.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip; Or could we?</p>
<p>
	Much has been made over the mistakes Telerik made in launching Sitefinity 4 and the subsequent bad taste it left in the mouths of hundreds of the most influential developers in the US. As a CMS, however, its drag-&amp;-drop nature does lead to a smoother learning curve. Considering that the last time I used a CMS there wasn&rsquo;t yet a term for it, this was a very good thing.</p>
<p>
	I liked how it allowed us to give CSS development to one member once we had a flimsiest notion of what the style would be, by allowing those of us developing pages to apply a template to our pages. The style would be developed on the template. Sitefinity pushed our widgets &amp; content blocks around to conform to the template. As it changed, our pages updated. I suppose that&rsquo;s the point of CSS in the first place, but this made it neat and clear.</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s even a way to design new widgets &amp; merge them into your Sitefinity process. Don&rsquo;t ask me how; the evangelist even admitted the process was arcane. Sounds like they need a new widget widget.</p>
<p>
	Saturday saw me actually learning &amp; taking a problem apart. Boy, was that messy! I assumed that a zip file that had all the GiveCamp branding files for media releases actually had all the GiveCamp branding files for media releases. Silly me. I must have lost an hour figuring out how come they didn&rsquo;t get recognized, and blamed the easy scapegoat, rather than looking at what I was sending up. Still, I had a good looking media page when I was done: some job satisfaction.</p>
<p>
	Sunday, I went through &amp; checked the new site to make certain that its links were pointing to the new site, and were relative, not absolute. Most were, save where I&rsquo;d done it wrong.</p>
<p>
	Socially, This was a good weekend. I came off like a newbie not a n00b, and think I gave a good acquittal of myself. Tim&rsquo;s bringing of Dominion was a hit. I tied once, but a poor strategy left me with too many cards in late game on the second. I crashed and burned.</p>
