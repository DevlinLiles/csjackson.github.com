	January 14-16, 2011<a href="http://givecamp.org/">GiveCamp</a></p>
<p>
	<a href="http://dallasgivecamp.org/">Dallas GiveCamp</a>: A chance to rub elbows with some of DFW’s strongest programmers, see them in action, and burnish my own resume a little in the process. Tim had to practically drag me along, pointing out that since I was working for free (less meals & snacks), there’s no way I could be less use to the project than my pay.</p>
<p>
	Turns out I should not have worried. As I met my team, there were several different skill levels present, and one, James, was a recent IT convert like myself. Also, since we were going to working in a new CRM that nobody had really seen before, everyone was going to be bumping around a good deal and asking each other lots of questions. Between that, and a quick explanation of my utter n00b status, folks seemed happy enough to work with me & nobody got frustrated with my pestering questions.</p>
<p>
	Friday afternoon started in a whirl. Tim likes to say he was useless that day, though his backpack was indispensable. Quickly accessing the needs of the project, the skills of his team, &amp; the limitations of the local internet access , he actually put us on Saturday morning’s problems a whole day ahead of every other team. Tim also became our team’s IT manager for the event, turning his beast of a laptop into both a local network hotspot, and a server so that we could install Sitefinity 4, and actually get to work.</p>
<p>
Or could we?</p>
<p>
	Much has been made over the mistakes Telerik made in launching Sitefinity 4 and the subsequent bad taste it left in the mouths of hundreds of the most influential developers in the US. As a CMS, however, its drag-&-drop nature does lead to a smoother learning curve. Considering that the last time I used a CMS there wasn’t yet a term for it, this was a very good thing.</p>
<p>
	I liked how it allowed us to give CSS development to one member once we had a flimsiest notion of what the style would be, by allowing those of us developing pages to apply a template to our pages. The style would be developed on the template. Sitefinity pushed our widgets & content blocks around to conform to the template. As it changed, our pages updated. I suppose that’s the point of CSS in the first place, but this made it neat and clear.</p>
<p>
	There’s even a way to design new widgets & merge them into your Sitefinity process. Don’t ask me how; the evangelist even admitted the process was arcane. Sounds like they need a New Widget widget.</p>
<p>
	Saturday saw me actually learning & taking a problem apart. Boy, was that messy! I assumed that a zip file that had all the GiveCamp branding files for media releases actually had all the GiveCamp branding files for media releases. Silly me. I must have lost an hour figuring out how come they didn’t get recognized, and blamed the easy scapegoat, rather than looking at what I was sending up. Still, I had a good looking media page when I was done: some job satisfaction.</p>
<p>
	Sunday, I went through & checked the new site to make certain that its links were pointing to the new site, and were relative, not absolute. Most were, save where I’d done it wrong.</p>
<p>
	Socially, this was a good weekend. I came off like a newbie not a n00b, and think I gave a good acquittal of myself. Tim’s bringing of Dominion was a hit. I tied once, but a poor strategy left me with too many cards in late game on the second. I crashed and burned.</p>
<p>
	Terms I had to look up:</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system">CMS</a>: Content Management Service</p>
<p>
	People I met:</p>
<p>
	Tim Proffitt</p><p>
	He was our team&rsquo;s CSS guy</p>
<p>
	Peter Karaganis&nbsp</p><p>
	He led our content translation effort</p>
<p>
	James Porter</p><p>
The other IT guy who is likewise changing to development. He did more cable-pushing while I was helpdesk.</p>
<p>
	Brett Stinson<p>
	Another team member, though we didn&rsquo;t interact as much, due to proximity.</p>
<p>
	Amed Subhani<p>
	Charismatic, and passionate about India cuisine. Introduced us to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanachur">chanachur</a>. I’m hooked.</p>
