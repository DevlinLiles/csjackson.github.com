	As I sat franticly taking notes at <a href="http://www.ddnug.net/">Dallas .Net User Group</a> on the Jan. 13, I realized I was engaged in time travel. These notes made very little sense to me at the moment. I was writing to a future version of myself in hopes that he will be able to translate these runes, and divine some coherent meaning out of them.</p>

	Rapid Application Development for Silverlight Business Applications</p>

	Further R&amp;D: <a href="http://www.develop.com/">Developmentor</a> Sneed&rsquo;s blog is there, which I now follow. + webinars.</p>
<p>
	Terms I needed to look up:</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731082.aspx">WCF</a>: Windows Communication Foundation: a system that allows for asynchronous communication. A simple example is a chat program that isn&rsquo;t constantly sending messages, but is capable of it whenever either side needs to.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/glossary/RIA">RIA</a>: Rich Internet Application: an app that is designed to run in a browser window. Flash games come to mind.</p>
